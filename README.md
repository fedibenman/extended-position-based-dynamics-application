an application of the extend position dynamics methode using c++ as the programming language ,glm for mathematic calculation,glfw for windows, the application is not yet fully complete ,
for essence the volume constraints are atterly ruiend right now making it always drop into a flate surface even with hight stiffness,also the normal coordinants are not taken care for 
since my main objective was to apply the xpbd aspect of it ,for further not the volume constraints would be fixed further on.
